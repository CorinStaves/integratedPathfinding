**[Work in progress]** This repository contains a collection of tools and code for network conversion, routing, matrix generation, and accessibility calculations for GLASST and JIBE.

The routing algorithms are based largely on code by the swiss federal railway (SBB) which can be found here:
https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/matsim-sbb-extensions

## Runnable methods:
### network/CreateMatsimNetworkRoad.java

Creates a MATSim network (.xml) using the edges and nodes .gpkg files. The attributes to be brought over from the edges
file to MATSim must be defined in this code.

### network/WriteDirectedNetwork.java

Creates a directed 2-way edges file (.gpkg) using the matsim network given, which whatever attributes that might be useful 
(the attributes to be written can be specified in this code).
This is useful for visualisations in which attributes are different in each direction.
Note that the output from this code is only meant for visualisation, it is not meant to be taken as input anywhere else.

### RouteComparison.java

Calculates the routes between any number of zones (minimum 2). Zone names are passed in as arguments. 
Can specify one or multiple routing algorithms in this code by defining different travel disutility functions. 
In the current code there are 4 routing possibilities:
- shortest distance
- fastest
- jibe (our custom jibe algorithm)

You can specify the results to be written to a .gpkg file (with geometries) or .csv file (without geometries). 

You can try the following postcodes as an example. These can be passed into the code in arguments 6â€“11.
